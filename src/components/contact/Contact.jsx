            <div className="recommend_card">Eric took on the role as project manager for our final group project. He suited the role well as he is very easy to work with as well as organized. He gave out specific tasks to each of us, he offered his help as much as possible, he also was great with communication. Not to mention he made the logo for our website! He also did a great job of organizing study groups that a few other students and myself always utilized as it was a great place to grow together as new developers. Eric's ability to problem solve serves him well as a programmer and I would strongly recommend him for any team. - Hunter Coleman</div>
            <div className="recommend_card">I had the pleasure of working in a team with Eric on two different projects during our time at the University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp. For our first project, Rotten Potatoes, I was the project manager, and I was very impressed with Eric's communication skills and ability to meet deadlines in a timely manner. For our final project, Dollars and Bills, Eric had the chance to be the project manager, and he showed his exceptional leadership skills. Outside of these projects and outside of class, Eric and I (and a few other students) spent countless hours in Zoom study sessions. During these sessions, Eric always showed an eagerness to learn and a great sense of humor - making him a joy to work with. I am sure that Eric will be a great asset to whatever companies he decides to work with in the future, and I look forward to seeing him progress throughout his career. - Jae Ahn</div>
            <div className="recommend_card">Eric was the project manager for our last project in school, Dollars and Bills. He did an incredible job keeping the team motivated and on the task at hand. During the course of the bootcamp Eric was always in study group (most of the time creating them) and willing to help with any problems. His communication skills, both written and spoken are outstanding and something to be admired. Eric was a great asset to have in school and he will be a tremendous asset to any company. - Amber Robeck</div>
